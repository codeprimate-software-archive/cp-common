This is a test file for the FileContentFinder class in the com.cp.common.util package of the cp-common API and framework.

This is a test. This is only a test.  If this had been an actual emergency, then this test would have been followed
by the angst to figure out what the hell is wrong with the FileContentFinder class.  The monkeys who coded such a mess
would not understand why such a simple program could be such a pain in the @ss.  It would be necessary to then piss
and moan for a good twenty minutes at the computer which is only logically inclined to follow out stupid little
instructions despite our ignorance.  After coming to our senses, only then do we realize that our comparison is wrong 
and that we wasted a bunch of time because we were careless and prone to error, after all, we are only human.

Never leave a human to do a machines job!

What more garbage can I fill this file with.  Later on, I definitely need to replace this crap with something worthy
of Mordore.

Give me back my precious; fealthy stickin Hobbitzies, they stole my precious.

Hobbitzies keep bad chips, stupid fat hobbitz.

All we have to do is decide what to do with the time that is given to us.

Well, thats all folks...
