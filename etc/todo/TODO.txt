1.  Design and implement a framework for sorting, an extension of the Sort API.
Create a abstract factory for which service provider implementations can be provided.
Implement differenct sorting algorithms such as Heap Sort.
Create a SortType enumerated type to be used by the factory.
Provide a multi-threaded implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
Explore possible extensions to the Search API. - DONE

2.  Create more tests for Cache API & Framework, comparable to the Record API and Framework.

3.  Design and implement a Chart/Diagram/Graph API & Framework - v2.0 - ?

-> may defer, see the JFreeChart API & Jide Software

4.  Design and implement a Print API & Framework - v3.0

5.  Design and implement a Look & Feel for Codeprimate - v4.0 - ?

6.  Create more tests for the Record class and Record API & Framework in general. - DONE

7.  Provide a System property that the SPI Factories (such as CacheFactory and RecordFactory) check to determine if the
reference provider implementation should be overridden. - DONE

-> Implemented the com.cp.common.util.PropertyManager class

8.  Provide case-sensitive comparison functionality for the FileComparatorFactory Comparators.

9.  Add layer functionality to the com.cp.common.swing.Matte and com.cp.common.swing.GridCanvas classes.

10.  Add an enumerated-type package with default enumerations.  Design as an API & Framework so extensions can determine
the source of information for each enumeration. - DONE

-> Added the com.cp.common.util.enumx package of classes.

11.  Create the log4j package with custom renderers for the Collection classes. - DONE

-> Added com.cp.common.log4j package of classes.

12.  Add tests for the swing AbstractDataModel, DateModel and TimeModel classes. - DONE

-> Even implemented the CalendarModel class.

13. Provided automated tests for classes in the awt and swing package. - DONE

14.  Figure out how to get the ALT-LEFT and ALT-RIGHT arrows working on the XDesktopPane Swing UI component class.

15.  Finish the com.cp.common.beans.AbstractBeanTest. - DONE

16.  Re-implement the MultithreadedQuickSort algorithm; use the HPROF tool to analyze the algorithm for performance.

17.  Remove the DistributedQuickSort algorithm and associated type from the SortType enumerated-type class. - DONE

18.  Implement the com.codeprimate.util.search.IndexedSearch class.

19.  Undeprecate methods in the com.cp.common.awt.WindowUtil class. - DONE

20.  Rename some of the XXXMultiAcceptor classes (such as FileFilterMultiAcceptor) to XXXComposite after the
Composite Design Pattern. - DONE

21.  Switch all logging through-out the cp-common API & Framework to use commons-logging API.

22.  Move the cp-common API & Framework over to the Java SE 5 platform. - DONE

23.  Remove all calls in the code to deprecated methods of the Java SE 5 platform. - DONE

24.  Remove all warnings in the code during compilation. - DONE

25.  Re-implement the different caching data structures and algorithms of the Cache API & Framework to use the
SoftReference class.
